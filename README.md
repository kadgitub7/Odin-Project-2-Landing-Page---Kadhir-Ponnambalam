# Odin-Project-2-Landing-Page---Kadhir-Ponnambalam
This is a project that I made for the Odin Project number 2 Landing page. I made it to replicate a design that was provided by the assignment that I will link below to demonstrate my CSS foundations

I have a link to the image of the landing page that I was tasked with replicating using HTML and CSS foundations: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
